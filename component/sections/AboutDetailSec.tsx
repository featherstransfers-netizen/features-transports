            Our Alpine Journey
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          With a love of France and particularly its spectacular mountains, we have been based in the French Alps for thirty years. During all of this time, we have been running Travel and Tourism companies: an apartment rental business (pre Air BnB!), catered chalets, property renovations and hotel management.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          When the opportunity came to sell our Spitting Feathers Apr√®s Ski Bar in La Plagne Bellecote, we jumped at the chance to concentrate solely on airport transfers and out of this has been born 'Feathers Transfers'.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
         As a small, yet very experienced operator, we take pride in our ability to offer exceptional reliability, personalised attention, and a level of service perhaps unmatched by larger competitors.
