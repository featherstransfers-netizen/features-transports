            <li><strong>Feathers Transfers</strong>: Will refer to the company SARL Squires SIRET: Nº: 49224507100021.</li>
            <li><strong>Client</strong>: Shall be the person that makes the booking for themselves or on behalf of other persons.</li>
            <li><strong>Party</strong>: Shall refer to all persons travelling under one single booking.</li>
            <li><strong>Passenger</strong>: Shall refer to a person within a party.</li>

        </div>

        <div className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">1. Contract</h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4">
            <li>Once we receive your completed booking form and payment, we will send you e-mail confirmation of your booking. The date of the contract is the date that appears in the confirmation e-mail.</li>
            <li>Where two or more Passengers are included on the same booking, the Client purchasing the booking shall be deemed to do so on the basis that he/she acts as an agent for both or all members of the Party and accepts these booking conditions on behalf of each member of the Party.</li>
            <li>You must check the details on the confirmation email as soon as you receive it and notify us of any errors immediately as it may not be possible to make changes at a later date.</li>
            <li>The confirmation email is your ticket so please print a copy or have a PDF copy on your phone to bring with you when you travel. In the case of missed flights or flight delays forcing you to miss your transfer, we will ask you to fill in a declaration for your travel insurance for the cost of your new transfer.</li>
            <li>Where Feathers Transfers book for travel on services provided by operators other than Feathers Transfers, we do so as agents for the operator concerned whose own conditions of carriage will apply and our liability will be confined to travel on our own services.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">2. Changes</h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4">
            <li>The destination and pick-up addresses you have supplied to Feathers Transfers are the addresses to which you will be delivered and collected. Should you wish to change these or any other details, this must be done by email directly with Feathers Transfers at least two days prior to the date of travel.</li>
            <li>If you request any change to the pick up or drop off location, flight details or number of Passengers and this generates an additional charge (for example, if there are extra members of your party or the flight time changes), you will have to pay the additional cost at the time of making the change. In this instance, no administration fee will be charged.</li>
            <li>If the change reduces the fare a refund will be offered, subject to a reasonable administration fee, as long as these changes are made at least 48 hours in advance of travel.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">3. Payment</h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4">
            <li>A 200.00€ booking deposit is required at the time of booking unless an alternative arrangement has been made with Feathers Transfers. Upon receipt of the booking deposit Feathers Transfers will produce written confirmation of the details regarding the booking by email. The balance payment is due fifty six days before travel. For refunds following cancellation by the Client, please see below.</li>
            <li>The deposit is strictly non-refundable except in circumstances where Feathers Transfers, due to causes beyond its control, cancels or, at its absolute discretion, agrees to cancel the booking.</li>
            <li>Night Rates: For transfers requiring a driver to work between midnight and 06h00 there is a 75.00€ supplement per vehicle which may be waived at the company's discretion.</li>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">4. Cancellation</h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4">
            <li>Clients are entitled to cancel the booking by email.</li>
            <li>If the Client cancels six weeks or more before their flight arrival date, Feathers Transfers will refund the full booking fee less an admin fee of 100.00€. If the Client cancels less than six weeks but more than two weeks before their flight arrival date, Feathers Transfers will refund 50% of the booking fee. If the Client cancels less than fourteen days before the flight arrival date, this will not give rise to a refund. In each scenario, the Client will receive an email confirming the cancellation of their transfer.</li>
            <li>Requests to cancel your booking must be sent to us by email with a read receipt and will not take effect until received/opened by us. If the service does not meet your expectations, and you wish to apply for a refund for any other reason, please contact us using details below.</li>
            <li>In the case of cancelled or missed flights or flight delays forcing you to miss your transfer, Feathers Transfers will try to, but are under no obligation, to fulfil your transfer request nor refund any of your transfer fee. In such circumstances you should fill in a declaration for your travel insurance for the cost of your new transfer for which you will be charged. Any extra charge can and may be waived or reduced at the company's discretion.</li>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">12. Jurisdiction</h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4">
            <li>Feathers Transfers shall only be liable for any reasonable and foreseeable consequential losses arising directly out of a breach in contract. Nothing can affect the consumers' statutory rights.</li>
            <li>Feathers Transfers' Terms and conditions are governed by French Law and any dispute between Feathers Transfers and a third party, if not resolved by mutual agreement, shall be referred to a mediator. However, if mediation is unsuccessful, then the matter of the dispute will be referred to a formal litigation process through the French courts.</li>
